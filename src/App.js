            We are group of neighbours and friends that have have some nice
            things in common. Primarely, we all live in the third part of
            Skojevsko Naselje that is located in Municipality of Rakovica -
            Belgrade, Serbia. Second, we all have big passion for cats and made
            some budget to make their life in our neighbourhood the best
            possible for any living cat.

            The main advantage of living in our neighbourhood is that we live
            near the Ko≈°utnjak forest, and have lots of green fields and trees
            as well. With the proper deeds from our group, slowly but steadily
            other our neighbours started having affection towards cats, so we
            were a huge part of that together with our amazing friends üòª! Let
            us introduce them to you!
